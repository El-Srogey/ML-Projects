## 👋 <span style="color:green">Introduction</span>

This repository contains 3 exciting projects showcasing my machine learning skills:

### 🎥💻 <span style="color:purple">Fine-Tune Real-ESRGAN:</span> 
In this project, I scraped high-resolution images from pedestrians videos on YouTube and fine-tuned the Real-ESRGAN model to enhance the images.

### 🎬💰📊 <span style="color:purple">Movenu:</span> 
In collaboration with my team, we scraped IMBD data about movies to predict their future revenue. We then deployed our model using Flask to create a stunning website for movie enthusiasts.

### 🤖🚀📊 <span style="color:purple">Quick-Start OpenAI API (Streamlit, Jupyter):</span> 
In this project, I quickly set up the OpenAI API using Streamlit and Jupyter notebooks to develop a range of machine learning applications.
