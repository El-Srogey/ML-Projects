## 👋 <span style="color:green">Introduction</span>

This repository contains 3 exciting projects showcasing my machine learning skills:

### 🎥💻 <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16uPCy6S6dPVe09Wc6YiuvKZGbAqYGqmZ?usp=sharing'> <span style="color:purple">Fine-Tune Real-ESRGAN:</span></a>
In this project, I scraped high-resolution images from pedestrians videos on YouTube and fine-tuned the Real-ESRGAN model to enhance the images.

### 🤖🚀📊 <a href='https://github.com/El-Srogey/ML-Projects/tree/main/OpenAI'><span style="color:purple">Quick-Start OpenAI API (Streamlit, Jupyter):</span> 
In this project, I quickly set up the OpenAI API using Streamlit and Jupyter notebooks to develop a range of machine learning applications.

 ### 🎬💰📊 <span style="color:purple">Movenu:</span> 
In collaboration with __my team__, we scraped IMBD data about movies to predict their future revenue. We then deployed our model using Flask to create a stunning website for movie enthusiasts.
